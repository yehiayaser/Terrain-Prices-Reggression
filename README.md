# 🏞️ Terrain Prices Regression Challenge

Welcome to the Terrain Prices Regression Challenge! 🌍

## 🔍 Problem Description

Accurate terrain valuation is crucial for real-estate investors, urban planners, and developers. The price of a land plot depends on multiple factors, including:

- **Location type:** beach, mountain, urban, rural, etc. 🏖️🏔️🏙️🌄  
- **Land-use zoning:** residential, commercial, agricultural, industrial 🏗️  
- **Terrain characteristics:** elevation, slope, soil quality 🌱  
- **Accessibility:** proximity to roads, public transport, water sources, amenities 🚗  
- **Local economy:** average income, crime rate, real-estate market conditions 📏📈  

Your goal is to build a model that captures the complex relationships between these factors and land price.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Training set:** 1,500 samples with target prices  
- **Test set:** 1,200 samples without target prices

### Features (40 total)

- **Categorical:**  
  - `location_type`, `land_use`, `zoning_code`

- **Numerical:**  
  - `elevation`, `slope_deg`, `soil_quality`, `median_income_area`, `crime_rate`, `amenities_score`, etc.  

- **Area metrics:**  
  - `land_area_m2` (total plot size)  
  - `price_per_m2` (target variable)
